					  1.1 Our shopping pages will guide you through the steps you need to take to place an order with us. Our order process allows you to check and amend any errors before submitting your order to us. Please take the time to read and check your order at each stage of the order process. Alternatively, you can request that a member of our customer services team places an order on your behalf.</br>

1.2 After you place an order you will receive three emails from us including the following:</br>

1.2.1 An email acknowledging we have received your order ("Order Confirmation") stating that the order is being processed by our system;</br>

1.2.2 An email to notify you that the item has been 'picked' from stock and allocated to your order, at which point your card will be charged; and</br>

1.2.3 Final email containing the tracking number so that you can track delivery of the Goods online.</br>

1.3 When you submit your order and receive an Order Confirmation from us, this does not mean that we have accepted your order, this only means that the order has been successfully received into our system. Following Order Confirmation, we will undertake validity and verification checks. Subject to receiving clear results from such checks, a contract will come into existence between you and us and we will provide you with an email to confirm that the product has been 'picked' from stock and allocated to your order (as detailed within condition 1.2.2) above.</br>

1.4 We shall assign an order number to your order and inform you of this in the Order Confirmation. Please quote the order number in all subsequent correspondence with us relating to your order.</br>

1.5 We may send you an email to say that we do not accept your order. This is typically for the following reasons:</br>

1.5.1 The Goods are not available.</br>

1.5.2 we cannot obtain authorisation of your payment;</br>

1.5.3 we are unable to meet your requested delivery date;</br>

1.5.4 It fails the security checks; or</br>

1.5.5 There has been an error by us in the pricing or description of the goods.</br>

1.6 If we are unable to supply you with the Goods, for example because the Goods are not in stock or are no longer available, we will inform you of this by email and we will not process your order. If you have already paid for the Goods, we will refund you the full amount as soon as possible.</br>

1.7 The images of the Goods on our website are for illustrative purposes only. Although we have made every effort to display the products accurately, we cannot guarantee that your device's display will accurately reflect the Goods. The Goods delivered to you may vary slightly from those images.</br>

					  2.1 The price of the Goods will be as shown on our website at the time we confirm your order. Our prices include VAT at the current valid rate. UK VAT is charged to all shipping locations in the EU, with the exception of France, Germany, Italy and Spain where local VAT is charged. For other destinations, such as the US, no VAT is due but the price you pay remains the same.</br>

2.2 The price of the Goods does not include delivery charges, which will be notified to you during the checkout process and before you confirm your order.</br>

2.3 Any promotional prices or deals are subject to availability and may be withdrawn at any time.</br>

Incorrect pricing</br>
2.4 We take all reasonable care to ensure that the prices of Goods are correct at the time when the relevant information was entered onto the system. However it is always possible that, despite our reasonable efforts, some of the Goods on our Site may be incorrectly priced. We will normally check prices as part of our despatch procedures so that:</br>

2.4.1 where the Goods' correct price is less than the price stated on our Site, we will charge the lower amount when despatching the Goods to you; and</br>

2.4.2 if the Goods' correct price is higher than the price stated on our Site, we will contact you as soon as possible to inform you of this error and we will give you the option of continuing to purchase the Goods at the correct price or cancelling your order. We will not process your order until we have your instructions. If we are unable to contact you using the contact details you provided during the order process, we will treat the order as cancelled and notify you in writing. If the pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could have reasonably been recognised by you as a mispricing, we do not have to provide the Goods to you at the incorrect (lower) price.</br>

Price Increases</br>
2.5 Our prices change daily. Generally, we release new prices on a schedule and prices change at midnight only, however, we may also update prices during working hours. Subject to conditions 1.5.5 and 2.4, price changes will not affect orders once a contract is in place in accordance with condition 1.3.</br>

2.6 All manufacturers generally have price increases throughout the year, due to increases in manufacturing costs and inflation. While we try to absorb as much of these costs ourselves, these price increases are unavoidable. We always aim to notify customers of pending price increases on the product details page.</br>

2.7 We do not have control over prices listed on external sites, including Google cached listings, shopping feeds or any other site. We are not obliged to provide products for any price which is listed on an external site. We do not have control of the rate at which search engines crawl our site, and therefore the information in the search results may not be indicative of up to date prices.</br>

3.2 Payment ican be made through M-Pesa services. You will be given a Buy Goods number where you can send money as you order for your goods</br>

3.3 All credit and debit cardholders are subject to validation checks and authorisation by the card issuer. If the issuer of your payment card refuses to authorise payment to us, we will not be liable for any delay or non-delivery. We may also need to use extra security steps through Verified by Visa, Mastercard®SecureCode or American Express SafeKey.</br>

3.4 We reserve the right to reject a payment or order that we feel is at risk or could be fraudulent. In this instance the price will be refunded using the same payment method and you will be contacted and offered the opportunity to pay by another means or to cancel your order.</br>
