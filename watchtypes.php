					  With the development of new technologies, mainly the rotor, soon came the self-winding watches. These “automatic” ones, would wind up from the kinetic energy of one’s own wrist; meaning you didn’t need to take time to manually wind them.

Notice the metal piece covering half of the back of the movement in this Jaeger LeCoultre. That's the rotor. Movement of the wrist makes it pivot on its staff, which allows the watch to keep ticking forever.

					  Quartz watches don’t rely on extremely complex mechanical parts in order to work. They are powered by an electronic oscillator regulated by the vibrations of a quartz crystal in order to work. They were popularized in the 1980’s, and now most of the worlds wristwatches and clocks have a quartz movement. These are sometimes referred to as electric watches.

Above you can see a Swatch Jellyfish, a Quartz Skeleton watch. Watches that expose their inner workings are called “skeleton watches”. They are mostly mechanical, although there are some quartz variants as the Swatch here. As you can see, a Quartz looks vastly different than the other movements.

					  The original field watches were the ones used in both world wars, and were expected to perform under the pressure of combat. Their key features were ruggedness, decent waterproof rating, luminescence and clear, easy to read dial. Modern incarnations are inspired on this past designs, and evoke a military aesthetic. They usually come in a NATO strap, as it became a standard in the army.</br>

					  A dress watch is meant to accompany a gentleman on formal occasions, and compliment a suit and tie. Be either a business meeting, a fancy date or a wedding, dress watches are classy, elegant, and straight to the point. No fancy complications nor functions, just plain style. They also tend to be rather smaller timepieces, and in the past their size used to vary between 34 and 38 mm.</br>

					  In general, a dive or diver’s watch is any watch with 200+ water resistance rating. They were originally meant to accompany divers on their trips deep below the sea. Since they were used on top of a diving suit, they used to be bigger, and needed to be easily read even in an extremely dark environment. They also featured a rotating bezel. This was meant to be able to countdown and tell the diver how much oxygen was left on the tank, translated in minutes. A diver would set the bezel before diving, then check again afterwards and read “i’ve got 10 minutes left before oxygen runs out”. Since they needed to be in constant contact with seawater and seawater corrosion, diver watches demanded high quality materials, usually high grade stainless steel, or a copper alloy such as bronze or brass.</br>

Examples of diver watches: Pontvs Nessi, Rolex Submariner, Vostok Amphibia</br>
However, the diver style became extremely popular after Sean Connery’s James Bond used it with a Nato strap on Dr. No. Since then the Rolex Submariner has easily become one of the most recognizable watch designs, and “diver watch” a synonym of similar watches.

					  This is a regular watch with a stopwatch complication. The usual layout for this watches is to have 2 extra smaller dials, which are meant to keep track of time from when you start the stopwatch until you stop it. The complication is regulated by extra crowns on the side. Usually, the top crown starts the stop watch, and the bottom one resets back to the start. They can keep track of events within an elapsed time (for example, what time it took to complete a lap in a race), and is vital in some life or death scenarios, such as military tactics and piloting..</br>

					  A racing watch tends to be a step up from a regular chronometer, and usually includes a tachymeter in order to measure distance displaced within a time frame. They sport rather busy dials, meant to somewhat replicate the instruments present on a racing car.</br>

					  Just like divers, aviation pilots had particular needs from a watch. Back in the day computers were nonexistent or extremely limited, so, in practice, pilot watches became a supporting tool for pilots, and helped them time events and support their on board equipment. Pilot watches usually are bigger and have bigger crowns (as they were expected to be worn on top of gloves, and be manipulated through gloves). Besides from this, they usually sport a chronometer and tachymeter complication, and even GMT or dual time zones.</br>
