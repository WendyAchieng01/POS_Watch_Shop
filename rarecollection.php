					 There are only 20 Rolex Paul Newman Daytonas in the world with the Sotto configuration, in which the word Cosmograph appears above the word Oyster. But this model also has an ultra-rare "tropical brown" dial.

"The collecting community has given that term to watches whose dials have aged from black to brown," Boutros said. "And the more uniform the aging is, the more desirable.”

Rare can be an overstatement, but this watch actually deserves it. Rolex only made twelve of these watches in the ’40s and gave them away as gifts to race car drivers like Ettore Bugatti. The model you're looking at is one of only eight that have been found to date.

Rolex's Zerographe prototypes were the first watches in the world to boast rotating bezels, a feature now found on Rolex's GMT and Submariner. Because each one is essentially a one-off, "to find one, it's like a unicorn," Boutros said.

This Patek Philippe, made in 1955, was one of the only waterproof chronographs the company made before 1990. That's what's kept it in superb condition: over the years, no moisture has gotten into the case to damage the components.

This Daytona is one Boutros said he'd buy for himself. "Rolex custom-made each of these for a doctor," he said. It's "one of four or five ever made with a pulsation scale." (That's the subtle blue band around the outer edge of the dial, which helped doctors measure patients' heart rates.)

"This is the equivalent of a Ferrari 250 SWB in the collectors’ world," Boutros said of this watch. It's in fantastic shape for something made in 1956, and it's the first time this one is appearing at an auction. "You have here one of the most desirable watches of all time.”

"This is a wolf in sheep's clothes," Boutros said of this deceptively simple watch. Even though it only has one complication, it's a unique timepiece thanks to its black dial and its stylized numerals. It's also never even been worn. "For those who know, it is the most important, most beautiful, and possibly the most valuable time-only wristwatch in the world.”

Rolex made only two references that included a moon-phase complication, and this is one of them. What sets this one apart is its black dial and the hand-applied gold-star indices. That's where it gets its name, Stelline. (This is the other watch Boutros told us he'd bid on.)

In the watch world, you win a lot of points for something unique. This is the only known Patek Philippe that has a Calatrava cross symbol installed at the dial's 12 o'clock position. It was also the most complicated watch in existence (check out that leap-year indicator at 3 o'clock) when it was first produced in 1990.

This 18K-gold watch looks brand new, but it's actually almost 60 years old. Its bezel is made from Bakelite, a synthetic plastic that cracks pretty easily. The fact that it's been intact for several decades adds to its value. Expect a big splash from this watch: It's the current record holder for a GMT sold at auction, fetching CHF 290,000 in 2009.
